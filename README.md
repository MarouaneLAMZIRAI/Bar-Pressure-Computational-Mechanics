# Bar-Pressure-Computational-Mechanics
In this project, we aimed to analyze the pressure distribution on a bar under varying conditions and gain valuable insights into its structural behavior. By leveraging the power of VTK, a robust and versatile visualization library, combined with the flexibility of Python, we were able to create an efficient and insightful analysis tool.
